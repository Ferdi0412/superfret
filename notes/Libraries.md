# Audio
[RtAudio](https://github.com/thestk/rtaudio/tree/master) - by same people as RtMidi.

# SIMD
[eigen](https://github.com/PX4/eigen) - alternative to tools like `immintrin.h`.

# Plugins
[iPlug2](https://github.com/iPlug2/iPlug2) - Seems more lightweight than JUCE & is Open!

[JUCE](https://github.com/juce-framework/JUCE) - Industry standard, but derived works must be licensed or also Open.
